This file runs the STOCK_TRACKER app using a kivy interface. API Keys for alpaca markets are required to run the application. 
Create a .env file and add your 4 keys: API, SECRET, PAPER, and SECRET_PAPER.
Change API_MANAGER script to add your keys using os import.
I used pyvenv to configure a venv with the required .python-version and the according required packages.
